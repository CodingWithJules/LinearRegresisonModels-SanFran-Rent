▶️ Our aim is to help a client understand key factors affecting rental prices in the San Francisco area. The goal is to be able to use our model to predict the appropriate price range for new apartments in the city 🏙️. ◀️

👨‍🔬 Performing different types of linear regression can improve the accuracy of predicting rental price ranges by accounting for various factors that influence rental prices. 

For example, simple linear regression 👩‍🔬 may consider only one predictor variable, such as the number of bedrooms, while multiple linear regression can incorporate multiple predictors like square footage, location, amenities, and more. Polynomial regression can capture nonlinear relationships, allowing for a more flexible modeling of rental price trends. 

By using various types of linear regression, you can better capture the complex interplay of these factors and thus enhance the accuracy of your rental price range predictions 🧬.
